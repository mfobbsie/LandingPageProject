## Introduction
**My Landing Page** is a personal portfolio website designed to introduce myself to potential employers and showcase some of my early web development projects. The page includes a hero section, project highlights, and a brief background about my journey into tech.

This project was built using **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for styling. One of the more challenging aspects was positioning the hero text beside the profile image. Initially, the layout felt too long and unbalanced until I learned to separate the content into two divs—one for text and one for the image—allowing them to sit side‑by‑side cleanly.

As I continue to grow as a developer, I plan to update the showcased projects with more advanced work and refine the visual style to better reflect my personal aesthetic.
